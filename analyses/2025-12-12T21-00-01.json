  "summary": "This clause outlines the process for terminating the lease agreement before the agreed-upon end date. Both the landlord and tenant can terminate the lease with 30 days written notice. If a tenant terminates the lease early, they may be required to pay a termination fee, the amount of which is not specified in this clause. This fee is intended to compensate the landlord for the costs associated with finding a new tenant.",
  "recommendations": [
    "Specify the exact amount or calculation method for the termination fee.  Vague language like 'termination fee' is problematic.",
    "Clarify whether the termination fee covers the landlord's entire loss or is capped at a specific amount.",
    "Include a clause stating the landlord's obligation to mitigate damages by actively seeking a replacement tenant.",
    "Ensure the 30-day notice period complies with local laws, as some jurisdictions may require longer notice.",
    "Add a clause addressing the tenant's right to terminate early without penalty if the landlord breaches the lease agreement (e.g., failure to maintain the property)."
  ],
  "negotiation_script": {
    "vendor": "Could you please clarify how the termination fee is calculated and what expenses it covers? Also, can you confirm that you will actively seek a replacement tenant to minimize the financial impact on me if I need to terminate the lease early?",
    "contract_additions": [
      "A clause stating the termination fee will not exceed one month's rent.",
      "A clause requiring the landlord to actively mitigate damages by listing the property for rent promptly and showing it to prospective tenants.",
      "A clause allowing early termination without penalty if the landlord fails to maintain the property in a habitable condition.",
      "A clause specifying that any rent received from a new tenant after the early termination date will be credited towards the termination fee."
    ],
    "contract_removals": [
      "Any language that attempts to waive the tenant's right to a habitable dwelling as a condition for lease termination.",
      "Any language that imposes a termination fee exceeding what is reasonably necessary to cover the landlord's losses."
